2. R
3. SQL
4. Julia

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

1. **NumPy** - A library for numerical computations, providing support for arrays and matrices along with mathematical functions.
2. **Pandas** - A library for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures like DataFrames for structured data.
3. **Matplotlib** - A library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
4. **Scikit-learn** - A machine learning library for data modeling, preprocessing, and evaluation.
5. **TensorFlow** - An open-source framework for machine learning and deep learning.

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.


```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
answer = (3 * 4) + 5
print(answer)
```

```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
hours = 200 / 60
print(hours)
```
